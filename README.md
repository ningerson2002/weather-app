# Weather App :cloud:

## Overview

This is a simple yet powerful weather application built in Python. It provides real-time weather information for any location, giving users access to current conditions, forecasts, and more. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ningerson2002/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace YOUR_API_KEY in the code with your actual API key.

4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python weather_app.py
   ```

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for the application.
- **Requests:** Used for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Tkinter:** The GUI toolkit for creating the graphical user interface.
